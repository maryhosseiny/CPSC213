Modify the program q3.c in a10.zip (see Question 1) to use a mutex and zero or more condition variables so that every thread prints a before any thread prints b. 
This type of synchronization is called a barrier and we say that threads all rendezvous at the barrier before any are allowed to continue past it.

Your solution must block any threads that cannot run while they wait for the other threads. You may not use a polling loop nor call uthread_yield.

Your solution must work for any value of NUM_THREADS. For example, for 3 threads your program must always output the following.
a
a
a
b
b
b
------
