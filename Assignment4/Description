In this assignment you will learn more about structs in C and how they are implemented by the compiler. You will:
1. Learn how to debug a simple C program
2. Convert a small Java program to C with structs
3. Convert a small C program to assembly

After completing this assignment you should be able to:
1. read and write C code that includes structs
2. compare Java classes/objects with C structs
3. explain the difference between static and non-static variables in Java and C
4. distinguish static and dynamic computation for access to members of a static struct variable in C
5. distinguish static and dynamic computation for access to members of a non-static struct variable in C
6. translate C struct-access code into assembly language
7. count memory references required to access struct elements
