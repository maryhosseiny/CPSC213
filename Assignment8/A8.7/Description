The code below is the same Assembly code found in the previous question. 
It contains uncommented assembly code that corresponds to a single C procedure starting at address 0x300 and another procedure that sets up the stack and calls the first procedure.

Write an equivalent C program that is a likely candidate for the program the compiler used to generate this assembly file (with the exception of the stack-setup code, which is only for the Assembly file). 
Call this program q2.c.

For your solution to pass the handin tests it must declare a procedure named q2 that encapsulates the code starting at address 0x300, that has the appropriate number of arguments (in the correct order), 
and that returns the appropriate value. 
To test your code, you can include a main procedure and any other procedures you like, though note that the autograder will ignore any method other than q2.
