Under the q3 directory you will also find a file called sortmain.c. 
You should implement this program such that it sorts the arguments as elements, placing the integers first (as compare would do). 
You must use the C function qsort to do so. qsort is a built-in C function which sorts an array, given a suitable comparison function. 
You should use it to sort a dynamic array of element pointers, by giving it a comparison function that calls the element’s virtual compare function. 
You may need to do some pointer casting to make it all work out.

You do not have to have implemented int_element and str_element to do this part; 
the autograder will use fully-implemented versions of the int_element and str_element classes to test your code. 
As usual, you must ensure that your code is free of memory errors and leaks using valgrind.

Comment: In normal sort implementations, comparisons between mixed types would not be allowed, as comparisons between multiple different types aren’t usually defined (is a struct less than a string? How about an int?). 
However, for this problem, since we have only two types we can declare that “integers are smaller than strings”.
