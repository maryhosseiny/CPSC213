Like a real processor, the simulator has a memory and a CPU. You will implement both of them as java classes. This week you will implement the memory.

Some portions of the memory are already implemented. Your job is to implement and test the five methods of MainMemory.java labeled with TODOâ€™s. 
You will find this file in your IntelliJ environment in the arch.sm213.machine.student package. (Please refer to Question 2 "Install the Simple Machine" for the package.)

Implement the following methods:

- isAccessAligned that determines whether an address is aligned.
- bytestoInteger and integerToBytes that translate between an array of bytes and a big endian integer.
- get and set that provide array-of-byte access to memory used by the CPU to fetch and to store data. Follow the specification listed in the javadoc comments carefully. 
Note, for example, that the address provided to these methods is not required to be aligned.
