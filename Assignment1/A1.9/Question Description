Create a set of JUnit tests to test your implementation. 
Place all of your tests in a class named MainMemoryTest in the same package as the MainMemory class. 
Note that you will not actually be able to run the simulator itself yet beyond the initial screen, because you will still lack a CPU implementation.
Ensure that your tests provide good test coverage for each of five methods you implemented. Comment each test to explain what it is testing.
