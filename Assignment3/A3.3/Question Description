Produce your own sm213 file, q2.s, that does what the highlighted lines in q2.c does; you do not need to translate the lines that are marked as ignored.

Note that you can run the C program, specifying input values on the command line to see what the program should do. 
In the simulator you will enter the inputs directly in the memory locations of variables, and you will examine the output the same way.
