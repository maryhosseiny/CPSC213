In the previous question you created a program called bubble_sort_dynamic.c that reads an unlimited number of elements from the command-line arguments and sorts them using the Bubble-Sort algorithm.

Now, create another C program called bubble_sort_awesome.c that extends your earlier work. This program must not include any square brackets anywhere (including comments!). 
All access to the arrays must be made using pointer arithmetic and the dereference operator (i.e., *).
