In the previous question you were presented with the program bubble_sort_static.c that reads four elements from the command-line arguments and sorts them using the Bubble-Sort algorithm.
Create a new C program named bubble_sort_dynamic.c that removes the static-array limitation of the original version. 
The only change you need to make is to turn val into a dynamic array and to allow the program to sort arbitrary lists of integers provided on the command line (e.g. more than 4).

Recall that you need to allocate dynamic arrays dynamically by calling the procedure malloc. For example to allocate an array of 10 shorts you say: short *s = malloc (10 * sizeof(*s));
